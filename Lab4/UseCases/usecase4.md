# Use Case 4

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Drag and Draw with Left-Click*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *To allow a pixel color change wherever the mouse is located.*

**Preconditions**: *The program must be running and in a responsive state.*

**Trigger**: *(1) Select 'Pencil' function on the tool bar. (2) Press and not release the left button of user's mouse on the canvas.*
  
**Scenario**: *A user will drag their mouse to the tool bar to select 'Pencil' function. When the mouse is pressed and a user left-clicks (i.e. on the pressed event, not released) a pixel color will change wherever the mouse is located on the canvas. *
 
**Exceptions**: *If the app have an unexpected error, it will provides an error message and allows the User to save the work and restart the app.*

**Priority**: *High-priority.*

**When available**: *First release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates through the mouse. The system is responsible for maintaining focus of the window when the user clicks, and should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for all other input.*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *We may need to implement 'Brush' functionality in the future, and give users more choice for thier future creation.*
